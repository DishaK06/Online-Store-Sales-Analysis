## Summary

The Dashboard provides multiple visualizations to analyze sales data, including breakdowns by Shipment mode, Segment, Category, Monthly trends, and Top-performing cities.
Users can filter the data by Year, City, and Region using the dropdown menus at the top.
Key performance indicators, such as Profit, Total customers, Products, and Orders, are displayed and will be updated based on the applied filters.

## Key Insights
<ul>
  
  <li>Standard Class shipment mode offers a balance between affordability and speed, making it the preferred choice for many customers. However, customers are willing to pay more for faster shipping options (First Class).</li>
  <li>While the Consumer segment generates the most sales, it might not be the most profitable.</li>
  <li>Technology products are the best-selling category, but a deeper dive into profitability by category might reveal more insights.</li>
  <li>There seems to be a trade-off between sales volume and profitability between Eastern and Western regions.</li>
  
</ul>

## Data-Driven Decisions

<ul>
  
  <li>Invest in optimizing Standard Class shipping to potentially reduce costs without significantly impacting delivery speed.</li>
  <li>Examine the profitability of different customer groups to identify which ones are the most lucrative. Then, adjust marketing strategies to target these profitable segments specifically.</li>
  <li>Explore reasons behind the low profit margin in the East region and identify areas for cost optimization.</li>
  <li>Consider offering bundled product packages that combine Technology products with high-margin categories like Furniture or Office Supplies.</li>
  
</ul>
